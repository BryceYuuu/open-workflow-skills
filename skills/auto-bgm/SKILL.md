# Auto BGM / 视频自动配乐

## Purpose / 用途

**中文**

分析视频情绪和节奏，生成或匹配背景音乐并进行 Ducking；选曲质量仍具有主观性和版权约束。

**English**

Analyze scene and pacing to suggest or place background music and apply ducking; music selection remains subjective.

## Status / 状态

- **Release status:** 🟡 Experimental / Assisted / 实验性 / 辅助完成
- **Audit grade:** C
- **Quality score:** 2.5/5
- **Automation level:** L3
- **Category:** Content & Media / 内容创作与媒体

> Status describes implementation risk, not whether the underlying capability is imaginary. Integration skills require external services or authorization. Experimental skills are technically feasible but quality or end-to-end reliability varies.

## Search aliases / 搜索关键词

`auto-bgm` · `Auto BGM` · `视频自动配乐` · `automatic background music` · `video BGM` · `music ducking` · `视频配乐` · `自动BGM` · `AI content automation` · `content automation` · `video automation` · `social media automation` · `内容自动化` · `视频自动化`

## When to use / 何时使用

Use this skill when the user explicitly requests **auto bgm**, or when the requested outcome clearly matches this workflow.

Do not activate it merely because the topic is related. Confirm the input, desired output, and any consequential external action.

## Inputs / 输入

- Video/audio file or URL
- Desired language/style/output constraints

## Outputs / 输出

- Content/media outputs
- Manifest / QA notes

## Core stack / 核心工具

`Audio analysis / music source / FFmpeg`

## Permissions / 权限

- `filesystem:read`
- `filesystem:write`
- `network:optional`

Treat permissions as capabilities to request or verify, **not as permissions automatically granted by installing the skill**.

## Workflow / 工作流

1. **Inspect / 检查输入** — Verify source files/data, format, scope, and user constraints.
2. **Plan / 制定计划** — Select the deterministic tools, model calls, and external integrations needed.
3. **Preflight / 运行前检查** — Check dependencies, credentials, permissions, destination paths, and destructive-action risk.
4. **Execute / 执行** — Run the smallest reliable sequence of steps. Prefer deterministic code for calculations, parsing, rendering, and file operations.
5. **Validate / 验证** — Verify output structure, counts, schemas, file readability, test results, or other task-specific invariants.
6. **Review / 审核** — For subjective or consequential outputs, present a reviewable result before external publication, sending, payment, deployment, signing, or irreversible action.
7. **Report / 汇报** — State what was produced, where it was saved, what was verified, and what still needs human review.

## Dependency suggestions / 依赖建议

- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg`

The Agent Skill itself should remain installable even when optional runtimes are absent. Report missing runtime dependencies instead of silently installing privileged software.

## Install / 安装

### Inspect before installing

```bash
npx skills add BryceYuuu/open-workflow-skills --list
```

### Install this skill into the current project

```bash
npx skills add BryceYuuu/open-workflow-skills --skill auto-bgm
```

### Install for a specific supported agent

```bash
npx skills add BryceYuuu/open-workflow-skills --skill auto-bgm --agent codex
```

`npx skills` is a community ecosystem CLI, not an OpenAI-official installer. Review third-party skills and scripts before granting shell, filesystem, network, or credential access.

## Example invocation / 调用示例

**中文**

> 使用 `auto-bgm` 工作流处理我提供的输入。先检查依赖和权限，不覆盖源文件；执行后给我输出路径、验证结果和需要人工审核的部分。

**English**

> Use the `auto-bgm` workflow for the provided input. Check dependencies and permissions first, preserve the source, validate the result, and report outputs plus any human-review items.

## Validation / 验证

At minimum:

- Verify all expected outputs exist and are readable.
- Verify the source was not unintentionally overwritten.
- Verify structured outputs against their expected schema or invariants.
- Record warnings, skipped steps, external dependencies, and failed checks.
- Never mark the workflow successful solely because a model produced text.

See `references/QUALITY.md` for skill-specific quality expectations.

## Safety / 安全

- Do not invent source facts or claim an external action succeeded without verification.
- Preserve source files unless the user explicitly requests in-place modification.
- Surface missing dependencies, permissions, credentials, and failed checks clearly.
- Label generated outputs as candidates or assisted results and require human review before consequential use.

## Failure handling / 失败处理

If a dependency, credential, connected service, browser session, file, or required permission is unavailable:

1. Stop the affected step.
2. Preserve completed safe outputs.
3. State exactly what is missing.
4. Do not fabricate a successful result.
5. Suggest the minimum next action needed to continue.

## Files / 文件

- `SKILL.md` — workflow instructions
- `references/QUALITY.md` — quality/evaluation guidance
- `tests/cases.yaml` — example evaluation cases

Implementation scripts may be added under `scripts/` when deterministic execution materially improves reliability.
