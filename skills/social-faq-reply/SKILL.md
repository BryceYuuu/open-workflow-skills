# Social FAQ Reply / 社交媒体 FAQ 回复

## Purpose / 用途

**中文**

识别私信和评论中的 FAQ，生成批准范围内的回复草稿；退款、投诉等敏感情况升级人工。

**English**

Classify incoming social questions, draft approved FAQ answers, and escalate sensitive cases before any external reply action.

## Status / 状态

- **Release status:** 🔵 Integration Required / 需要外部集成
- **Audit grade:** B
- **Quality score:** 4.0/5
- **Automation level:** L3-L4
- **Category:** Communication & Social / 沟通与社交

> Status describes implementation risk, not whether the underlying capability is imaginary. Integration skills require external services or authorization. Experimental skills are technically feasible but quality or end-to-end reliability varies.

## When to use / 何时使用

Use this skill when the user explicitly requests **social faq reply**, or when the requested outcome clearly matches this workflow.

Do not activate it merely because the topic is related. Confirm the input, desired output, and any consequential external action.

## Inputs / 输入

- Message/content facts
- Audience, tone, length, and channel

## Outputs / 输出

- Primary requested artifact
- Validation or review notes

## Core stack / 核心工具

`Social platform connector / FAQ store`

## Permissions / 权限

- `external-account`
- `network`
- `human-approval`

Treat permissions as capabilities to request or verify, **not as permissions automatically granted by installing the skill**.

## Workflow / 工作流

1. **Inspect / 检查输入** — Verify source files/data, format, scope, and user constraints.
2. **Plan / 制定计划** — Select the deterministic tools, model calls, and external integrations needed.
3. **Preflight / 运行前检查** — Check dependencies, credentials, permissions, destination paths, and destructive-action risk.
4. **Execute / 执行** — Run the smallest reliable sequence of steps. Prefer deterministic code for calculations, parsing, rendering, and file operations.
5. **Validate / 验证** — Verify output structure, counts, schemas, file readability, test results, or other task-specific invariants.
6. **Review / 审核** — For subjective or consequential outputs, present a reviewable result before external publication, sending, payment, deployment, signing, or irreversible action.
7. **Report / 汇报** — State what was produced, where it was saved, what was verified, and what still needs human review.

## Dependency suggestions / 依赖建议

- No universal runtime package is required by the skill format itself. Install only the tools named in **Core stack** when your chosen implementation needs them.

The Agent Skill itself should remain installable even when optional runtimes are absent. Report missing runtime dependencies instead of silently installing privileged software.

## Install / 安装

### Inspect before installing

```bash
npx skills add BryceYuuu/open-workflow-skills --list
```

### Install this skill into the current project

```bash
npx skills add BryceYuuu/open-workflow-skills --skill social-faq-reply
```

### Install for a specific supported agent

```bash
npx skills add BryceYuuu/open-workflow-skills --skill social-faq-reply --agent codex
```

`npx skills` is a community ecosystem CLI, not an OpenAI-official installer. Review third-party skills and scripts before granting shell, filesystem, network, or credential access.

## Example invocation / 调用示例

**中文**

> 使用 `social-faq-reply` 工作流处理我提供的输入。先检查依赖和权限，不覆盖源文件；执行后给我输出路径、验证结果和需要人工审核的部分。

**English**

> Use the `social-faq-reply` workflow for the provided input. Check dependencies and permissions first, preserve the source, validate the result, and report outputs plus any human-review items.

## Validation / 验证

At minimum:

- Verify all expected outputs exist and are readable.
- Verify the source was not unintentionally overwritten.
- Verify structured outputs against their expected schema or invariants.
- Record warnings, skipped steps, external dependencies, and failed checks.
- Never mark the workflow successful solely because a model produced text.

See `references/QUALITY.md` for skill-specific quality expectations.

## Safety / 安全

- Do not invent source facts or claim an external action succeeded without verification.
- Preserve source files unless the user explicitly requests in-place modification.
- Surface missing dependencies, permissions, credentials, and failed checks clearly.
- External writes, sends, submissions, or production changes require explicit authorization; approval-gate sensitive actions.

## Failure handling / 失败处理

If a dependency, credential, connected service, browser session, file, or required permission is unavailable:

1. Stop the affected step.
2. Preserve completed safe outputs.
3. State exactly what is missing.
4. Do not fabricate a successful result.
5. Suggest the minimum next action needed to continue.

## Files / 文件

- `SKILL.md` — workflow instructions
- `references/QUALITY.md` — quality/evaluation guidance
- `tests/cases.yaml` — example evaluation cases

Implementation scripts may be added under `scripts/` when deterministic execution materially improves reliability.
